## Wordle Solver

This project is a Python script designed to solve the popular word-guessing game, Wordle. The script leverages a custom scoring system to evaluate potential guesses and strategically filters words based on feedback from each guess. It interacts with a Wordle API to submit guesses and receive feedback.
